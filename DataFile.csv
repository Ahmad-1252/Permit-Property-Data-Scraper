I am trying to figure out who to get ahold of or how to move forward with some concerns I have with my apartment and living conditions.  My husband and I live at Albany Landings Apartments and we have reached out to them regarding some concerns and many have been pushed to the side and not addressed or resolved. The most important being the possible black mold in our apartment. We have multiple pictures of what resembles black mold throughout the apartment and both of us have been sick multiple times since moving in. We have consistently had respiratory issues and skin irritation since living here. The longer we have been here the worse it’s getting. We emailed them about a month ago addressing our concerns and nothing but a walk through had been done where they told us all our issues would be resolved after we moved out following our lease.  My other concern was electrical. The maintenance person came to fix our light switches that stopped working and after being almost shocked and causing a huge spark stated when these apartments were updated the electrical wiring was Jerry - rigged.

I am trying to figure out who to get ahold of or how to move forward with some concerns I have with my apartment and living conditions.  My husband and I live at Albany Landings Apartments and we have reached out to them regarding some concerns and many have been pushed to the side and not addressed or resolved. The most important being the possible black mold in our apartment. We have multiple pictures of what resembles black mold throughout the apartment and both of us have been sick multiple times since moving in. We have consistently had respiratory issues and skin irritation since living here. The longer we have been here the worse it’s getting. We emailed them about a month ago addressing our concerns and nothing but a walk through had been done where they told us all our issues would be resolved after we moved out following our lease.  My other concern was electrical. The maintenance person came to fix our light switches that stopped working and after being almost shocked and causing a huge spark stated when these apartments were updated the electrical wiring was Jerry - rigged. Thank you for your time and let me know if there is someone else I should be in contact with!,Active,
